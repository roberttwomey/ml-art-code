        "## 5. Context Managers\n",
        "\n",
        "Context managers are used to manage resources, such as file handles or network connections, that need to be acquired and released. They are typically used with the `with` statement to ensure that the resources are properly acquired and released.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example of a context manager for working with files:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
        "    content = file.read()\n",
        "    # Do something with the content\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the `open()` function returns a file object, which is a context manager. When the `with` block is exited, the file is automatically closed.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can create your own context managers using the `contextlib` module:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from contextlib import contextmanager\n",
        "\n",
        "@contextmanager\n",
        "def my_context():\n",
        "    print(\"Entering the context\")\n",
        "    yield\n",

        "    print(\"Inside the context\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Generators\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are a simple way to create iterators. They are defined like normal functions, but instead of returning a value, they `yield` it. When the generator is called, it returns an iterator object, but does not start execution immediately. The function continues from where it left off each time `__next__()` is called on the iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example of a generator that yields the Fibonacci sequence:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def fibonacci(count):\n",
        "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
        "    while count > 0:\n",
        "        yield a\n",
        "        a, b = b, a + b\n",
        "        count -= 1\n",

        "## 7. Multithreading and Multiprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "Python provides the `threading` and `multiprocessing` modules to work with threads and processes, respectively. Threads are lightweight, but they have limitations due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython. Processes, on the other hand, can take full advantage of multiple CPU cores but have higher overhead.\n",
